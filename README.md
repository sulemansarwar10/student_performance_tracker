- Add student names and their scores for different subjects.
- The program will calculate the class average and individual student performance.

## Files:
- `student_performance_tracker.ipynb`: Jupyter/Colab notebook for the project.


## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- If using Jupyter or Colab, simply run the cells in sequence.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/sulemansarwar10/student_performance_tracker.git`
